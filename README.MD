# Coding Exercise

This coding exercise is part of the application process for Greenback.

## Instructions

Please create a Java application that accepts an HTML file as input and
generates a JSON result.  Please refer to `invoice1.html` and `invoice2.html`
in this repository as two different sample inputs.  The files
`invoice1.json` and `invoice2.json` are the expected results.

You can use any 3rd party Java library to help build your application.  You should
note the differences between the two inputs and build an application that
elegantly handles either one.  Please write out the JSON result as
a file named the same as the input but with a .json extension.  For example, `input1.html`
should produce an output named `input1.json`.

Here are some helpful tips. The ordering of the keys in the output json is not important.  We just need to see that all the keys and their correct values are present (in any order).  Focus on the algorithm, not the UI.  We enjoy simple console (command-line) applications.  While we provided 2 examples, we will run your solution against a 3rd and 4th example to see how well it does.  Real-world input is messy and never clean, so we hope you spend time on error handling and defensive coding against real world inputs and data.

## Submission Instructions

* Create an account on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and create a private repo.
* Share private repo with joe AT greenback.com
* Please include instructions on how to run your application in your repo's README.md
* Email your Greenback contact OR careers@greenback.com to make sure we know you submitted your repository

We look forward to seeing what you code!
